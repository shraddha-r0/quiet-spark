    "response": "Ah, Shraddha, the dance of nerves and excitement\u2014what a beautiful thing it is. That feeling isn't just nervousness; it's your heart reminding you that you're alive, in the presence of possibility. You've already had one date, a testament to your courage and openness. \n\nTonight, allow yourself to flow, like a river finding its path. You carry within you stories, laughter, and those small quirks that make you, you. It's not about being perfect, but about being present. Trust in the magic that happens when you are simply yourself. Remember, it\u2019s as much about discovering them as it is about unveiling more of you. \n\nBreathe deeply, let your light shine, and see where this evening leads. You're on the precipice of something lovely, and that is a wonderful place to be. \ud83c\udf1f"
